# Super Anki (placeholder name)

A little (very very very early) project to create a web based spaced repetition app like anki.

#### Goals:
- open source
- user-friendly, intuitive design (maybe customizable using css later down the road)
- storing data locally (with IndexedDB) but also syncing via a server
- PWAs

#### Technologies:
- React
- Mantine React components
- data storage in the browser using dexie.js (IndexedDB)
